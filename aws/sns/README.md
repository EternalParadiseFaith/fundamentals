Amazon SNS is a Message publishing and processing service.

The A2A provides high-throughput push-based, many-to-many messagng between distributed systems, micorservices and event-driven serverless applications such as SQS, Kinesis Data Firehouse and Lambda.

The A2P functionality lets you send messages to your customers with SMS texts, push notifications and emails.

It is full managed and durable with automatic scaling. Like other PubSub models, this consists of topics and subscriptions.
