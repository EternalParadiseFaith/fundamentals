# Facade Design Pattern

- Structural Design Pattern: refactoring pattern, can be applied to both low and high level components
- Facade Class is hides details of other subsystems. Instead of calling subsystems it simply calls the facade class
- Inlcudes only those features the user cares about 
- Simplest Structural Design Pattern
- Good to think about API design
